# Store with web-page prefetching using Machine Learning

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.2. (NODE.js v.14.17.0)

Testing the Application:

Creating the Server:

Installing Additional Packages:

npm install --save-dev express@4.16.3

npm install --save-dev connect-history-api-fallback@1.5.0

npm install --save-dev https@1.0.0

npm install --global yarn

Building the Application for Production:

ng build --prod

This command builds an optimized version of the application without the additions that support the
development tools. The output from the build process is placed in the dist/WebStore folder. In addition
to the JavaScript files, there is an index.html file that has been copied from the WebStore/src folder and
modified to use the newly built files.

Starting the Production HTTP Server:

node server.js

Once the server has started, open a new browser window and navigate to http://localhost:80
